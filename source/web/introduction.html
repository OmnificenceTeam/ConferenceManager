                            Hello Everyone,
                        </span>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span>
                            Imagine organising a conference:
                        </span>
                        <br />
                        <ul id="imgine_points">
                            <li>with maximum participation through active interaction among participants</li>
                            <li>where you get to know what is of interest to each person who attends</li>
                            <li>which is cost effective</li>
                            <li>which is environment friendly</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <span>
                            I introduce you to the MedTrix Smartphone Conference Manager (MSCM), a conference app, which is compatible with iOS, Android and Windows devices. MSCM assists you in engaging with the attendees even prior to the start of the conference and keeps that engagement going during the event and even after it is done.

                        <br /><br />
                        <span>
                            The app provides an opportunity for conference attendees to connect, interact, learn, share comments, ideas and knowledge giving a complete control over the event experience. In a digitally connected world, MSCM provides you with assistance for staging your conferences successfully.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span>
                            MSCM is an environment-friendly alternative, reducing the usage of paper and printing, while also being cost-effective.  The hybrid build framework makes updating content instantaneous, making it easy to share all updates, changes in schedules, etc.
                        </span>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span>
                            I invite you to take a tour of the app to explore all the features and to understand why MSCM is ready to be part of your next event.
